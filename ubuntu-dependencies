## TODO clean this up

to get the python to be able to import cryptography, run:

sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip openssl libssl-dev libffi-dev

now pip can compile and install cryptography 

sudo pip install cryptography 

## merge dependency

the merge subcommands also depend on gnu diff utils. on ubuntu this can be:

sudo apt-get install diffutils

# postgres driver (psql backend was just for performance comparison):
sudo pip install psycopg2
